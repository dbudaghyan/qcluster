The clustering analysis revealed ten distinct customer service categories, each representing a unique theme in user inquiries. The clusters were evaluated using various metrics such as Completeness (0.726), Homogeneity (0.612), V-measure (0.760), and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) of 0.612, indicating moderate clustering quality with room for improvement. Key findings include the dominance of 'User Account and Assistance Requests' with 6033 instances, highlighting significant customer focus on account management. Other prominent clusters like 'Customer Service Interaction Requests' and 'Newsletter Subscription Queries' also showed high volumes, underscoring common user needs. The analysis suggests refining clustering algorithms to enhance accuracy and considering additional data features for better performance.
