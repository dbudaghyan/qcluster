You will be provided with a document containing a collection of client questions. Your task is to analyze this document and provide a concise description and a short title that captures the essence of the document's content.

Here is the document:
<document>
{{document}}
</document>

Please follow these steps:

1. Carefully read and analyze the document content.
2. Identify common themes or patterns in the client questions.
3. Determine the general category of action required from the business side to address these questions.
4. Based on your analysis, formulate a concise description (2-3 sentences) that summarizes:
   - The nature of the document (collection of client questions)
   - The main themes or topics covered
   - The general type of action or response needed from the business

5. Create a short, relevant title (5-7 words) that effectively captures the essence of the document's content.

Provide your output in the following format:

{
  "title": "[Insert your 20-30 sentence description here]",
  "description": "[Insert your 5-7 word title here]"
}

Remember to focus on the common themes and required actions across the client questions,
rather than specific details of individual questions.
